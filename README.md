# AppellF2

This Mathematica notebook is a draft of a custom implementation of the second Appell function (double hypergeometric series).

# Motivation

Only the first of the four Appell functions is natively implemented in the Mathematica software as of 2021.
Appell functions are frequently encountered when dealing with integrals of hypergeometric functions.
